# Training Week
Training week is a web-based application built in HTML/CSS and JavaScript that  
 allows strength athletes to visualize exercises that they may include in  
 their training, as well as view brief tutorial descriptions how certain  
 exercises are performed. This can be a useful tool when drawing up programs,  
 especially for individuals that work best with visual feedback, providing a  
 convenient alternative to notes or spreadsheets as a means of conceptualizing  
 training days.
